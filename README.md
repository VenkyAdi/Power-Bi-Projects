1. **SQL Queries**: A collection of SQL queries designed to extract relevant data from the water treatment plant database. These queries fetch real-time information on various aspects such as water quality, flow rates, chemical levels, and equipment statuses.

2. **Power BI Reports**: Power BI report templates configured to connect to the water treatment plant's SQL database. These reports offer intuitive visualizations and interactive dashboards to monitor the performance of the plant in real-time. Key metrics are presented in clear and comprehensive visual formats, enabling quick analysis and decision-making.

3. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation providing instructions on setting up the SQL queries, configuring Power BI to connect to the database, and customizing the visualizations according to specific plant requirements. This documentation ensures smooth implementation and utilization of the real-time monitoring system.

4. **Example Data**: Sample datasets showcasing the types of data collected and visualized in the Power BI reports. These datasets serve as a reference for understanding the structure and format of the data utilized in the project.

By utilizing this repository, water treatment plant operators and managers can gain valuable insights into the plant's performance, identify potential issues promptly, and make informed decisions to optimize operations and ensure the delivery of safe and high-quality water to consumers.
